Symfony Demo Application
========================

The "Symfony Demo Application" is a reference application created to show how
to develop applications following the [Symfony Best Practices][1].

Requirements
------------

  * PHP 7.2.9 or higher;
  * PDO-SQLite PHP extension enabled;
  * and the [usual Symfony application requirements][2].

Installation
------------

[Download Symfony][4] to install the `symfony` binary on your computer and run
this command:

```bash
$ symfony new --demo my_project
```

Alternatively, you can use Composer:

```bash
$ composer create-project symfony/symfony-demo my_project
```

Usage
-----

There's no need to configure anything to run the application. If you have
[installed Symfony][4] binary, run this command:

```bash
$ cd my_project/
$ symfony serve
```

Then access the application in your browser at the given URL (<https://localhost:8000> by default).

If you don't have the Symfony binary installed, run `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`
to use the built-in PHP web server or [configure a web server][3] like Nginx or
Apache to run the application.

Tests
-----

Execute this command to run tests:

```bash
$ cd my_project/
$ ./bin/phpunit
```

Youtube add
------------

To add youtube video you need to insert its id or full url in the corresponding field

If the video is not available or does not exist, you wonâ€™t be able to add it.

After adding, fill in the remaining fields for your video as necessary. All empty fields will be automatically received via api from the original video.

After clearing the field with the video id, the rest of the youtube fields will also be cleared.

To install your youtube api key go to config / services.yaml - youtube.apiKey
